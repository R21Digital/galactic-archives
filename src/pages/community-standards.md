## Community Standards

To maintain a positive experience, all users are expected to follow these basic principles:

1. Be respectful and constructive.
2. Avoid toxic behavior, harassment, or spam.
3. Credit original sources and contributors when sharing guides or media.
4. Use inclusive and welcoming language.

Content violating these standards may be removed, and repeat violations may result in access restrictions.
